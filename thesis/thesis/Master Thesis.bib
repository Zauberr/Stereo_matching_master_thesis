The immediate aim is high precision parallax assessment, point transfer, and point measurement. Experiments and theory have confirmed the high accuracy potential of the method. By implementation of charge coupled device (CCD) video cameras in an analytical plotter, an experimental hardware and software configuration has been established with which the operational on line application of digital image correlation for conventional photogrammetric measuring tasks can be tested.

  abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis. Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems. These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space, and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

Experimental results indicate that the algorithm outperforms previous schemes proposed for the same task and is fully comparable in accuracy with the `gold standard' bundle adjustment technique, rendering the whole approach both of practical and theoretical interest. With a view to practical application, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can be incorporated into the familiar random sampling and consensus technique, so that the resulting modified scheme is capable of robust fitting of fully consistent homographies to data with outliers.},

Projective scales have been used to measure within images from the beginnings of photogrammetry, mostly the cross-ratio on a straight line. However, there are also projective frames in the plane with interesting connections to affine and projective geometry in three dimensional space that can be utilized for photogrammetry. This article introduces an invariant on the projective plane, describes its relation to affine geometry, and how to use it to reduce the complexity of projective transformations. It describes how the invariant can be use to measure on projectively distorted planes in images and shows applications to this in 3D reconstruction. The article follows two central ideas. One is to measure coordinates in an image relatively to each other to gain as much invariance of the viewport as possible. The other is to use the remaining variance to determine the 3D structure of the scene and to locate the camera centers. For this, the images are projected onto a common plane in the scene. 3D structure not on the plane occludes different parts of the plane in the images. From this, the position of the cameras and the 3D structure are obtained.},

The Adaptive Least Squares Correlation is a very potent and flexible technique for all kinds of data matching problems. Here its application to image matching is outlined. It allows for simultaneous radiometric corrections and local geometrical image shaping, whereby the system
parameters are automatically assessed, corrected, and thus optimized during the least squares iterations. The various tools of least squares estimation can be favourably utilized for the assessment of the correlation quality. Furthermore, the system allows for stabilization and improvement of the correlation procedure through the simultaneous consideration of geometrical constraints, e.g. the collinearity condition. Some exciting new perspectives are emphasized, as for example multiphoto correlation, multitemporal and multisensor correlation, multipoint correlation, and simultaneous correlation/triangulation.},

Firstly, a hierarchical calculation of mutual information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching. Secondly, an approximation of a global cost calculation is proposed that can be performed in a time that is linear to the number of pixels and disparities.

We also consider filters like LoG, mean, and bilateral background subtraction (BilSub) and nonparametric measures like Rank, SoftRank, Census, and Ordinal. Finally, hierarchical mutual information (HMI) is considered as pixelwise cost. Using stereo data sets with ground-truth disparities taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the costs with a local, a semiglobal, and a global stereo method. We measure the performance of all costs in the presence of simulated and real radiometric differences, including exposure differences, vignetting, varying lighting, and noise. Overall, the ranking of methods across all data sets and experiments appears to be consistent. Among the best costs are BilSub, which performs consistently very well for low radiometric differences; HMI, which is slightly better as pixelwise matching cost in some cases and for strong image noise; and Census, which showed the best and most robust overall performance.},

Two of them aim to improve the disparity image especially at depth discontinuities, while one targets the identification of possible errors in general. Results are given on real stereo images with ground truth. A comparison with five standard correlation methods is provided. All proposed algorithms are described in detail and performance issues and optimisation are discussed. Finally, performance results of individual parts of the stereo algorithm are shown, including rectification, filtering and correlation using all proposed methods. The implemented system shows that errors of simple stereo correlation, especially in object border regions, can be reduced in real-time using non-specialised computer hardware.},

The method offers a very good trade off between runtime and accuracy, especially at object borders and fine structures. It is also robust against radiometric differences and not sensitive to the choice of parameters. Therefore, it is well suited for solving practical problems. The applications reach from remote sensing, like deriving digital surface models from aerial and satellite images, to robotics and driver assistance systems. This paper motivates and explains the method, shows current developments as well as examples from various applications.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the semiglobal matching (SGM) stereo method. It uses a pixelwise, mutual information (Ml)-based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement, and multibaseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments, and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed. A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2 seconds on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Ml-based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems.},

Determination of three dimensional data from images is very important task in the machine vision field. Stereo vision has wide range of potential application areas including three dimensional reconstruction of a view. Matching algorithms play a key role in deciding correspondences between two image scenes. Mainly, the matching algorithms are distinguished as area based matching and feature based matching. Area based methods sometimes called correlation like methods or template matching, merge the feature detection step with the matching part. These methods deal with the images without attempting to detect salient objects. Windows of predefined size is used for the estimation of correspondence. The major goal of this paper is to provide comprehensive reference for the researchers involved in, area based image matching.

Constraints based on the fundamental matrix, trifocal tensor or quadrifocal tensor are used to derive relationships between the position vectors of all the cameras at once. The resulting set of equations are solved using a SVD. The algorithm efficient computationally as it is linear in the number of matched points used. A key feature of the algorithm is that all of the images are processed simultaneously, as in the Sturm-Triggs factorization method, but it differs in not requiring that all points be visible in all views. An additional advantage is that it works with any mixture of line and point correspondences through the constraints these impose on the multilinear tensors. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm the method's utility.},

These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

The aim of this document is to propose a new method for solving the homography decomposition problem. This new method provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

Two main results are shown: (i) trilinear tensors across m{$>$}3 views are embedded in a low dimensional linear subspace, (ii) given two views, all the induced homography matrices are embedded in a four-dimensional linear subspace. The two results, separately and combined, offer new possibilities of handling the consistency across multiple views in a linear manner (via factorization), some of which are further detailed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobel\textendash Feldman operator or Sobel filter, is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges. It is named after Irwin Sobel and Gary Feldman, colleagues at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). Sobel and Feldman presented the idea of an "Isotropic 3x3 Image Gradient Operator" at a talk at SAIL in 1968. Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Sobel\textendash Feldman operator is either the corresponding gradient vector or the norm of this vector. The Sobel\textendash Feldman operator is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer-valued filter in the horizontal and vertical directions and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. On the other hand, the gradient approximation that it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high-frequency variations in the image.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of dual cameras in recently released smart phones, a growing number of super-resolution (SR) methods have been proposed to enhance the resolution of stereo image pairs. However, the lack of high-quality stereo datasets has limited the research in this area. To facilitate the training and evaluation of novel stereo SR algorithms, in this paper, we present a large-scale stereo dataset named Flickr1024, which contains 1024 pairs of high-quality images and covers diverse scenarios. We first introduce the data acquisition and processing pipeline, and then compare several popular stereo datasets. Finally, we conduct crossdataset experiments to investigate the potential benefits introduced by our dataset. Experimental results show that, as compared to the KITTI and Middlebury datasets, our Flickr1024 dataset can help to handle the over-fitting problem and significantly improves the performance of stereo SR methods. The Flickr1024 dataset is available online at: https://yingqianwang.github.io/Flickr1024.},

  abstract = {The ability to generate good model hypotheses is instrumental to accurate and robust geometric model fitting. We present a novel dynamic hypothesis generation algorithm for robust fitting of multiple structures. Underpinning our method is a fast guided sampling scheme enabled by analysing correlation of preferences induced by data and hypothesis residuals. Our method progressively accumulates evidence in the search space, and uses the information to dynamically (1) identify outliers, (2) filter unpromising hypotheses, and (3) bias the sampling for active discovery of multiple structures in the data\textemdash All achieved without sacrificing the speed associated with sampling-based methods. Our algorithm yields a disproportionately higher number of good hypotheses among the sampling outcomes, i.e., most hypotheses correspond to the genuine structures in the data. This directly supports a novel hierarchical model fitting algorithm that elicits the underlying stratified manner in which the structures are organized, allowing more meaningful results than traditional ``flat'' multi-structure fitting.}

  abstract = {In recent 3D TV market, the technologies addressing to the applications such as stereoscopic depth scaling, glass-free 3D display, and Free Viewpoint TV are getting more attentions. A low-cost solution that can synthesize intermediate views from stereoscopic input contents(left and right camera views) is strongly needed. To render the interpolated views, the depth information of the left and right views are commonly-used in view synthesis algorithm. Therefore, this thesis researches stereo matching algorithms, which generate disparity maps. We implement a state-of-the-art semi-global stereo matching algorithm(dynamic programming and cross based) with FPGA. Our solution also concerns several aspects include disparity map/sequences quality, hardware cost, and real-time performance. Afterward the stereo matching engine design is integrated into IMEC's 3D TV SoC prototype. Several peripheral components, include color space converters, video I/O adaptors and a dedicated memory hierarchy, are developed for supporting both stereo matching and view synthesis engines. Finally, the SoC prototype is evaluated with EP3SL150 FPGA chip. So far it can process dual channel XGA video format (1024x768 @ 60 FPS) in real-time performance and render an acceptable synthesized view quality for depth scaling application. This design shows a promising solution for the 3D TV market.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an algorithm through correlation coefficient computation is proposed for stereo matching of color images in micro stereovision. In this algorithm, the samples of matching output are acquired by the statistics of multi similarity measurements and multi-matching areas. On the other hand, the false matching results and the wrong matching results are partially filtered by performing the mean-square error statistics of matching output samples. Further more, a sub-pixel matching accuracy is expected by calculating the average values of two new samples derived from the mean-square error statistics. Another problem correlative with stereo matching algorithms, the performance evaluation of algorithms, is also discussed by considering the following parameters, CMSE value, valid scale, accuracy and single-pixel accuracy, etc al. The experiment results show that the stability and accuracy of stereo matching are partially improved after using multi similarity measurements and multi-matching areas, and an accurate degree 80\% is obtained when mean-square error of noise is less than the value 20.},

  abstract = {The image motion of a planar surface between two camera views is captured by a homography (a 2D projective transformation). The homography depends on the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, as well as on the 3D plane parameters. While camera parameters vary across different views, the plane geometry remains the same. Based on this fact, we derive linear subspace constraints on the relative homographies of multiple (/spl ges/ 2) planes across multiple views. The paper has three main contributions: 1) We show that the collection of all relative homographies (homologies) of a pair of planes across multiple views, spans a 4-dimensional linear subspace. 2) We show how this constraint can be extended to the case of multiple planes across multiple views. 3) We show that, for some restricted cases of camera motion, linear subspace constraints apply also to the set of homographies of a single plane across multiple views. All the results derived are true for uncalibrated cameras. The possible utility of these multiview constraints for improving homography estimation and for detecting nonrigid motions are also discussed.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},
