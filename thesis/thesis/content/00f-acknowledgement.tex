First of all, I would like to thank particularly my supervisor M.Sc. Bastian Erdnüß, who gave me the opportunity to work on a subject in my favorite field of study, computer version, and tirelessly took the time to provide me insightful suggestions. I am also grateful to Prof. Dr. Ralf Mikut for the advice throughout this master thesis. Last but not least, I have to thank my family for their continuous support and great help during my studies.
